        <h3>Out of action test</h3>
        After a battle, all models from your Crusade army that are destroyed at the end of the battle are restored to your Crusade force and all wounds they have lost are regained. This represents units replenishing their numbers, wounded warriors returning to the fray and battle tanks being recovered and repaired. The only lasting effects are any Battle Scars the unit acquires, as described below.
        <br>
        At the end of each Crusade battle, you must take an Out of Action test for each unit from your Crusade army that is destroyed. To do so, roll one D6. On a 2+, the test is passed and nothing happens. On a 1, the test is failed; you must now choose one of the following options for that unit.
        <br>
        Take a devastating blow or roll for a battle scar.

            <h3>Battle Scar</h3>
            Each time a unit gains a Battle Scar, either roll one Do and consult the table opposite to randomly determine which Battle Scar that unit has gained, or choose the Battle Scar that you think tells the best narrative. A unit can have more than one Battle Scar, but it cannot have the same Battle Scar more than once (if a duplicate result is rolled, roll again until a different result is rolled). A unit cannot have more than three Battle Scars; each time a unit with three Battle Scars fails an Out of Action test, you must select the Devastating Blow result for it. If the unit has no Battle Honours remaining, you must instead remove that unit from your Crusade force - it is permanently destroyed or otherwise unable to fight any more. Make a note of each Battle Scar a unit has on its Crusade card and subtract 1 from its Crusade points total for each Battle Scar it currently has. Note that this can mean a unit has a negative Crusade points total.

            <h2>Battle Honours</h2>
            Each time a unit gains a rank, it can gain one Battle Honour. Units can also gain additional Battle Honours by other means (such as by winning certain missions, fulfilling certain Agendas, etc.). Each time a unit gains a Battle Honour, increase its Crusade points total by 1 (if the unit is TITANIC, increase its Crusade points total by 2 instead). Make a note of each Battle Honour a unit has on its Crusade card. A unit can never have more than three Battle Honours unless it is a CHARACTER, in which case it can have up to six Battle Honours. Once the maximum is reached, each time a unit gains a new Battle Honour it must first remove one of its existing Battle Honours.
            <br>
            There are several categories of Battle Honours that can be bestowed upon a unit, such as Battle Traits, Weapon Modifications and Crusade Relics. Each time a unit gains a Battle Honour, you can select from any category.

            Weapon Modifications are upgrades made to a warrior's armaments that improve their lethality in combat. Each time a unit gains this Battle Honour, you must select one model in that unit (if the unit includes a CHARACTER model or Unit Champion, you must select that model <span class = "header">!! House Rule - You can choose any model in your unit, such as a sniper !!)</span>, then you must select one weapon equipped by that model. You cannot select a weapon that has already been upgraded by this Battle Honour and you cannot select a weapon that has already been replaced by an Enhancement or a Crusade Relic - such artefacts cannot be modified.
Each time you select a weapon, roll two D6 and consult the table below to randomly determine which two Weapon Modifications it gains (if a duplicate result is rolled, roll both dice again until two different results are rolled), or choose the two different Weapon Modifications that you think tell the best narrative.

            <h3>Crusade Relics</h3>
            Crusade Relics are rare items of power that your warriors discover as they quest across the galaxy. Only CHARACTER models can gain Crusade Relics. When a model gains a Crusade Relic, simply select the Crusade Relic that you want that model to have. A CHARACtER model can have any number of Crusade Relics, but the same Crusade Relic cannot be included in your Crusade force more than once. Crusade Relics can be found in many books, including this one.
            <br>
            There are three categories of Crusade Relics: Artificer Relics, Antiquity Relics and Legendary Relics. Some categories of Crusade Relic can only be given to CHARACTER models if their unit has achieved a particular rank, as shown in the table below.
            <br>
            Unlike other Battle Honours, which increase a unit's Crusade points total by 1 (or 2 if the CHARACTER unit is TITANIC), each time you give a CHARACTER model a Crusade Relic, you must increase its unit's Crusade points total by the amount shown in the table below instead. Each time you give a CHARACTER model a Crusade Relic, make a note of it on its Crusade card.
