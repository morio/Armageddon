Armageddon in the Deadlands

<p>
        As Armageddon churns, the southern Deadlands also roil with conflict.  The oil and water infrastructure of the Hive World, the refineries, plants, and manufactorums of this continent can easily shift the fate of the entire planet.
</p>
<p>
The Gatebreakers are forces both native to and called in to defend the Deadlands:  Astra Miltarum, Imperial Knights, and Space Marines who have all fought for the world before.  Their objective:  Repel the invaders, secure the continent, and protect the Imperium's interests.
</p>
</p>
<p>

The Desecrators are forces of invasion - Chaos Knights and Chaos Marines, working in convenient tandem with Necron Tomb World pillagers, seeking to conquer and despoil the planet at all costs.
</p>
<p>

The Marauders are a wild card:  A special Imperium Task Force arrayed of Black Templar, Custodes, Admech and Iron Hands.  Their goal is neither the protection nor destruction of Armageddon, but rather the swift extraction of a critical artifact:  The Helsreach Archive, the contents of an ark ship evacuated from Helsreach carrying holy relics, STC printouts, and heretical secrets.

    Mission 1 - Land fall

<p>A simple life, a hard life, cleaning the intakes and exhaust of a water plant every day is a thankless job that allows industry to continue on Armageddon. It did have one perk, the view over the Deadlands. The dunes, isles and jetties along the coast line were sparse with life but beautiful in their desolation. It was a distraction from the rumors another war was brewing in the North. Her father told her about the last war, how a greenskin had ripped her uncle in two before a space marine did the same to the Orc, remembering the stories made her shiver. She looked back out, fear made every hair on the back of neck rise. 
</p>
<p>
The sky. Everywhere were streaks of fire and smoke falling from space, the sirens went off at the plant, then the sonic booms shook her very bones. Soon tracer fire from the plant started barking back at anything that came nearby. In response a lascannon shot exploded next to her, making her dead set on the ascent back to the maintenance hatch. Closing the hatch didnâ€™t stop the one thought through her and all the people of plant H2O-707SMSH
</p>
<p>
<em>War is here.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Your landing head is highly defensible with great overwatch of the Deadlands, it would be better if the enemy didn't have the other half of it secure. To make things worse
  a warp storm is brewing and between you and them are a group of deamons, mad from the chaos leaking into Armegddon. Secure the area and if you can fly your banner over the enemies base.
