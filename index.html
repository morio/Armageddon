          The deadlands defenders' timely deployment stymied the invasion force and shocked the agents searching for their own gain.  This hard-won stability cannot be lost; the gatebreakers must continue to aggressivley deploy through the deadlands, and root out destabilizing forces that would allow Chaos to further take root in Armageddon.  The desecrators, shaken by the violent repulsion of their incursion, must now consolidate their few landings.  The marauders, expecting to be able to capitalize on a confused, unstable environment, scramble to cover territory and complete their sweep for clues to their ends.

Armageddon in the Deadlands

<p>
        As Armageddon churns, the southern Deadlands also roil with conflict.  The oil and water infrastructure of the Hive World, the refineries, plants, and manufactorums of this continent can easily shift the fate of the entire planet.
</p>
<p>
The Gatebreakers are forces both native to and called in to defend the Deadlands:  Astra Miltarum, Imperial Knights, and Space Marines who have all fought for the world before.  Their objective:  Repel the invaders, secure the continent, and protect the Imperium's interests.
</p>
</p>
<p>

The Desecrators are forces of invasion - Chaos Knights and Chaos Marines, working in convenient tandem with Necron Tomb World pillagers, seeking to conquer and despoil the planet at all costs.
</p>
<p>

The Marauders are a wild card:  A special Imperium Task Force arrayed of Black Templar, Custodes, Admech and Iron Hands.  Their goal is neither the protection nor destruction of Armageddon, but rather the swift extraction of a critical artifact:  The Helsreach Archive, the contents of an ark ship evacuated from Helsreach carrying holy relics, STC printouts, and heretical secrets.

<p>A simple life, a hard life, cleaning the intakes and exhaust of a water plant every day is a thankless job that allows industry to continue on Armageddon. It did have one perk, the view over the Deadlands. The dunes, isles and jetties along the coast line were sparse with life but beautiful in their desolation. It was a distraction from the rumors another war was brewing in the North. Her father told her about the last war, how a greenskin had ripped her uncle in two before a space marine did the same to the Orc, remembering the stories made her shiver. She looked back out, fear made every hair on the back of neck rise. 
</p>
<p>
The sky. Everywhere were streaks of fire and smoke falling from space, the sirens went off at the plant, then the sonic booms shook her very bones. Soon tracer fire from the plant started barking back at anything that came nearby. In response a lascannon shot exploded next to her, making her dead set on the ascent back to the maintenance hatch. Closing the hatch didn’t stop the one thought through her and all the people of plant H2O-707SMSH
</p>
<p>
<em>War is here.</em>
</p>
<p>
  Your landing head is highly defensible with great overwatch of the Deadlands, it would be better if the enemy didn't have the other half of it secure. To make things worse
  a warp storm is brewing and between you and them are a group of deamons, mad from the chaos leaking into Armegddon. Secure the area and if you can fly your banner over the enemies base.

    Mission 2 - Investigation of Distortion

<p>
  Off in the distance veil of distorted air blocks the view of your flank. With forward positions secure and scouts reporting nothing in front, you march your troops in mass to the rear. As soon as you close on the strange shimmer wall, it phases out with a loud thundering clap. Demons appear on the field along with an army from the other side of the field. Then a veil appears again cutting the field in half and then disappears, but this time high value locations have the same smaller version of the veil surrounding them, blocking the view of anything inside them.
  The same thing has occurred at the command post, you can walk past the barrier and see your staff, but nothing beyond, and walk out of the barrier and see nothing within. Armageddon continues to make battlefield chaotic but maybe you can use this to your advantage, if you don't your opponent will.

    Mission 3 - Shadow Relics

<div class="row">
  <div class="column">  
<p>
  The distortions of the last battle were happening all along the continent, in some places the fluctuating veils left behind ancient artifacts thought lost on the battlefields of Armageddon. Your scouts have identified one particular treasure trove guarded by stray demons. Though dust on the horizon indicates that another party has similar goals. Intel reports finding distortions in the area can allow what they call “shadow walking” from one distortion to another. If you can get there first and map out these distortions you’ll be able to maximize the movement of your troops and secured relics. Like it or not, you’ll have to take advantage of the warp if you want to have an edge on this battlefield.

  <div class="column">  
<p>
  The Warp is now aggressively present in the deadlands.  Rifts tear at the fabric of reality, demons desperately asserting themselves to feed upon the violence.  Stabilizing obsidian monoliths have been discovered, affording stability in the rapidly decaying war zone. Claim these monoliths. But be wary, scouts report units in the area vanishing with only the stink of sulfur and ozone left behind.
