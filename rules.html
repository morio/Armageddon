        Here are rules that don't have a specific guide. For more information on general Crusade rules check your core rule book or <a href="https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/crusade-rules/">https://wahapedia.ru/wh40k10ed/the-rules/crusade-rules/</a>

        <h3>Requisitions</h3>
Requisition points (RP) can be used to purchase Requisitions; these can upgrade individual units or your entire Crusade force. Each time you spend RP to purchase Requisition, reduce your Requisition points total by the cost of the Requisition purchased. Any Requisition points you do not spend are saved and can be used later.
<br>
As you play more battles, you can gain additional Requisition points, but a Crusade force can never have more than 10 (any additional Requisition points acquired beyond this are lost). Each time you play a battle, you will gain 1RP after that battle has been completed, regardless of the result of the battle itself. Keep track of how many Requisition points you have on your Order of Battle.
<br>
Players can always use the Requisitions found below. Additional Requisitions can be found in other publications. Each Requisition will tell you when it can be purchased; they can never be purchased during a battle (i.e. between the Begin the Battle and End the Battle steps of the mission). So long as you have enough Requisition points, there is no limit on the number of Requisitions you can purchase, the number of times you can purchase each Requisition or the combination of Requisitions you can purchase. If you do not have enough Requisition points to purchase a Requisition, you cannot purchase it.

<ul>
<li>Requisitions cost RP to purchase. You can never have more than 10RP.</li>
<li>Each battle you play gains you 1RP (win, lose or draw).</li>

[1RP] INCREASE SUPPLY LIMIT

Purchase this Requisition at any time. Increase your Crusade force’s Supply Limit by 200 points.

[1-3RP] RENOWNED HEROES
</div>
</div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">

When you first start a Crusade force, you can purchase this Requisition the first time you add a CHARACTER unit to your Order of Battle. After that point, you can purchase this Requisition each time a unit from your Order of Battle gains a rank. In either case, you cannot select an EPIC HERO unit, a unit that already has an Enhancement, or a unit that has either the Disgraced or Mark of Shame Battle Scars.
<br>
You can select one Enhancement that unit has access to (if using this Requisition when that unit gains a rank, this is instead of it gaining a Battle Honour). When doing so, that unit has access to any Enhancements described within any Detachment rules that it could use, even though you have not yet started to muster your army and so have not selected any Detachment rules yet.
<br>
If the selected Enhancement replaces a weapon that is a Crusade Relic or a weapon upgraded by Weapon Modifications, that Crusade Relic or Weapon Modifications are lost. Recalculate the unit’s points value as a result of gaining this Enhancement and update its Crusade card. You cannot make any changes that would cause you to exceed your Supply Limit.
<br>
This Requisition costs 1RP plus 1 additional RP for each other Enhancement that your Order of Battle contains (to a maximum of 3RP).
<br>
Example: If this Requisition was used to give a unit an Enhancement and one other unit in your Order of Battle already had an Enhancement, it would cost 2RP.

[3RP] LEGENDARY VETERANS

      <div class="column">
Purchase this Requisition when a unit from your Order of Battle (excluding CHARACTER units) reaches 30XP. That unit’s Experience points total is no longer limited to a maximum of 30 and it can now be promoted above the Battle-hardened rank. In addition, the maximum number of Battle Honours that unit can have is increased to 6.

      <div class="column">
Purchase this Requisition before a battle. Select one unit from your Order of Battle. You can change any wargear options models in that unit are equipped with as described on that unit’s datasheet. If you replace a weapon that is a Crusade Relic or a weapon upgraded by Weapon Modifications, that Crusade Relic or any Weapon Modifications are lost. Recalculate the unit’s points value as a result of any of these changes and update its Crusade card. You cannot make any changes that would cause you to exceed your Supply Limit.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="column">

Purchase this Requisition after a battle. Select one unit from your Order of Battle that has one or more Battle Scars. Select one of that unit’s Battle Scars and remove it from its Crusade card (for each Battle Scar removed, that unit’s Crusade points total will increase by 1).
<br>
This Requisition costs 1RP plus 1 additional RP for each Battle Honour that unit has (to a maximum of 5RP).
<br>
Example: If this Requisition was used to remove a Battle Scar from a unit with three Battle Honours, it would cost 4RP.

Recalculate the unit’s points value as a result of any of these changes and update its Crusade card. You cannot make any changes that would cause you to exceed your Supply Limit.
<br>
This Requisition costs 1RP plus 1 additional RP for every 2 Battle Honours the unit has, rounding up (to a maximum of 4RP).
