            This map has a special effect when an 11 is rolled for a the Warp Event (Warp Surge). There is a line that goes from the middle of each long edge of the map through the center, called Emperic Distortion. It obstructs all line of sight through it.

        <h3>MISSION OBJECTIVES (DIVIDE AND CONQUER & TO THE BOLD, VICTORY)
</h3>
        <p>
<div style="font-style: italic;">Divide and Conquer - Progressive Objective</div>
From the second battle round onwards, at the end of each player's Command phase, the player whose turn it is scores VP as follows:
<ul>
    <li>
 If they control one or more objective markers, they score 5VP.
    </li>
    <li>
If they control one or more objective markers on both sides of the Empyric Distortion, they score 10VP.
    </li>
</ul>
In the fifth battle round, the player who has the second turn scores VP as described above, but does so at the end of the turn instead of at the end of their Command phase. Each player can score a maximum of 65VP from this mission objective.
        </p>
        <p>
<div style="font-style: italic;">To The Bold, Victory - Progressive Objective</div>
At the end of each player's turn, the player whose turn it is scores 5VP if they control one or more objective markers not within their deployment zone that they did not control at the start of the turn.

            There is an Unbound Adversaries turn at the start of each battle round which happens after other 'start of the battle round' rules are resolved but before the first player's turn.
An Unbound Adversaries turn consists of a Movement phase, a Shooting phase, a Charge phase and a Fight phase. Where a rule refers to such a phase, to an opponent's Movement phase, Shooting phase, Charge phase or Fight phase, or to an opponent's turn, it also applies to the corresponding Unbound Adversaries phase or turn. For example, the Fire Overwatch Stratagem can be used in your opponent's Movement or Charge phase, and so can also be used in the Unbound Adversaries Movement or Charge phase.
If at any point, while following these rules, there is more than one way to resolve them (for example, if there are two enemy units that are the same distance from an UNBOUND ADVERSARIES unit, or if an UNBOUND ADVERSARIES model could target more than one unit in the Fight phase), the player whose Crusade army has a higher total of Warp counters decides for the rest of the phase. If there is a tie, players roll-off and the winner decides for the rest of the phase.

            </div>
            In the Unbound Adversaries Movement phase, each UNBOUND ADVERSARIES unit that is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units makes a Normal Move as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>That UNBOUND ADVERSARIES unit must end that move as close as possible to the closest enemy unit.</li>
                <li>Each model in that unit moves as close as possible to that enemy unit.</li>

                In the Unbound Adversaries Charge phase, each UNBOUND ADVERSARIES unit that is within 12" of one or more enemy units and is not within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units declares a charge that targets the closest enemy unit. When resolving an UNBOUND ADVERSARIES unit's charge move:
                <ul>
                    <li>That UNBOUND ADVERSARIES unit must end that move as close as possible to the closest enemy unit.</li>

    An UNBOUND ADVERSARIES unit will only make a Consolidation move if it can end that move within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units.

    UNBOUND ADVERSARIES units are the only units eligible to fight in the Unbound Adversaries fight phase, and they are not eligible to fight in any other Fight phase.

            Compare Crusade points, a difference of 5 or more, the Army with lower total Crusade points is the underdog and gets Crusade Blessing.See Crusade Blessings for claiming Universal or Faction blessings
            <div class="battle-order-header">[11] Declare Battle Formations</div>
            In the order stated below, both players now secretly note down:
            <ol>
                <li>Which of their Leader units will start the battle attached (they must specify which Leader unit is attached to which Bodyguard unit for proper XP assignment).</li>
                <li>Which of their units will start the battle embarked within TRANSPORT models (they must specify which units are embarked on which models).</li>

            </ol>
            <div>When both players have done so, they declare their selections to their opponent.</div>
            <div>In Armageddon missions, Reserves units cannot arrive during the first battle round, and any Strategic Reserves or Reserves unit that has not arrived on the battlefield by the end of the third battle round counts as having been destroyed, as do any units embarked within them (this does not apply to units that are placed into Strategic Reserves after the first battle round has started).</div>
            <div class="battle-order-header">[12] Deploy Crusade Armies</div>
            <div>Players now alternate setting up their remaining units one at a time, starting with the Defender. Each time a player sets up a TITANIC unit when it is their turn to set up a unit, they skip their next turn to set up a unit. A player's units must be set up wholly within their deployment zone - the Attacker's and the Defender's deployment zones are shown on the deployment map of each mission. If one player finishes deploying all their units, their opponent then deploys the remainder of their units.</div>
            <div>UNBOUND ADVERSARIES</div>
            <div>If your mission is using the rules for Unbound Adversaries, the mission rules may specify that these are set up on the battlefield now.</div>

            Some rules allow players to redeploy certain units after both armies are deployed. Unless otherwise stated, such rules are resolved in this step. Players alternate resolving any such rules, starting with the Attacker.
            <div class="battle-order-header">[14] Determine First Turn </div>
            Unless the mission briefing says otherwise, players roll off and the winner takes the first turn.
            <div class="battle-order-header">[15] Resolve Pre-Battle Rules</div>
            Players alternate resolving any pre-battle rules units from their Crusade army may have, starting with the player who will take the first turn.
            <div class="battle-order-header">[16] Set Warp Events</div>
            Unless the mission rules state the scale and intensity of the Warp Events, the players now determine these as described on page 98.
            <div class="battle-order-header">[17] Begin The Battle</div>
            The first battle round begins. Players continue to resolve battle rounds until the battle ends.
            <div class="battle-order-header">[18] End The Battle</div>
            The battle ends after five battle rounds have been completed. If one player has no models remaining in their Crusade army at the start of their turn, the other player may continue to play out their turns until the battle ends.
            <div class="battle-order-header">[19] Determine The Victor</div>
            <div>At the end of the battle, the player with the most Victory points is the winner. If players are tied, the battle is a draw. If every model in a player's Crusade army is painted to a Battle Ready standard, that player is awarded a bonus 10 Victory points.</div>
            <div>The victor of a mission can then claim the Victor bonus listed on that mission. If the game is a draw, neither player can claim the victor bonus. If you are playing an Armageddon Campaign, you should inform the Campaign Master of the result of the battle so that your alliance can be awarded the appropriate strategic points, as described on page 73.</div>
            <div class="battle-order-header">[20] Update Crusade Cards</div>
            The players must now update their Crusade cards for all the units they used in the battle by taking Out of Action tests for any that were destroyed, and selecting a unit to be Marked for Greatness (selected unit gains 3XP). If this results in any units gaining a rank, before the next battle, they can gain Battle Honours as described on page 60.
            <div class="battle-order-header">[21] Update Order Of Battle</div>
            Increase your Battle tally and Requisition points by 1, and make any notes that you wish to record following your battle. If you wish to add any units to your Crusade force or spend any Requisition points, do so and update your Order of Battle accordingly before your next battle,
